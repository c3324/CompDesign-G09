----------------------------------------------------------

The grammar was constructed as per the LL1 grammar pdf. 
Any deviations from the grammar results in an error.
There is slight error recovery depending on where the error occured.
Errors in the main scope will search for a next valid keyword or semi-colon, 
and then begin parsing again from the next statement or keyword.

Error recovery outside of the main scope is more limitted. 
Mostly tokens until the next keyword will be burnt, but function parameters
will burn until a right parentheses.

Error's report the grammar error that resulted in the error but this
does not always result in a meaningful error report. Syntax errors that
result in an epsilon path being taken or ignored can have particularly
meaningless or useless error messages.
